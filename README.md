# Hierarchically Embedded Social Dynamics in Vampire Bats
This is a repository of all data files and scripts used to study how movement at multiple, hierarchically embedded scales of movement affects the centrality of vampire bats. For a full description, please see the associated paper (or preprint), "Hierarchically Embedded Social Dynamics in Vampire Bats" by C. Raven A. Hartman, Imran Razik, Gerald S. Wilkinson, Ian M. Hamilton, Elizabeth A. Hobson, and Gerald G. Carter. Please contact Raven Hartman at hartman.424@buckeyemail.osu.edu if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.

All necessary R packages and NetLogo extensions are listed at the top of each R and NetLogo file, respectively. Filepaths will need to be edited to properly run code, however, most files should be ready to run unless otherwise stated.

This project is broken into subsections, each performing a different analysis or having a different function.

To run the entire analysis, start by entering the roost-switching folder and download the wilkinson2.csv. This file contains observations of roost-level associations, noting the time, place, and identity of bats in particular roosts (collected for the studies "Reciprocal Food Sharing in the Vampire Bat" and "The Social Organization of the Common Vampire Bat: I. Pattern and Cause of Association," both by Gerald S. Wilkinson). Then, download and run roost_switching.R, which will modify the original dataset to mark every observation of each bat to show whether a roost switch occurred, as well as how long it has been since this bat was observed switching roosts. This will generate the roost_switching.csv file. Alternatively, the roost_switching.csv file can be downloaded for direct analysis.

Concurrently, the imran.Rdata file can be downloaded from the cluster-switching folder, which shows the positions of bats in different corners of a roost in a captive colony of vampire bats (collected for the study "Non-Kin Adoption in the Common Vampire Bat," by Imran Razik, Bridget K. G. Brown, Rachel A. Page, and Gerald G. Carter). The cluster_switching.R code can then be run, which modifies the original dataset to denote the position of each bat, as well as whether a cluster switch occurred in each observation of the bat and the time since last cluster switch. This data is then outputted as cluster_switching.csv, which can alternatively be downloaded directly.

Finally, the events.Rdata file can be downloaded from the partner-switching folder, which shows a log of the grooming events for all bats in the same study of captive vampire bats ("Non-Kin Adoption in the Common Vampire Bat," by Imran Razik, Bridget K. G. Brown, Rachel A. Page, and Gerald G. Carter). The partner_switching.R code can then be run, which marks whether a bat has switched partners and time since last partner switch for each bat in the study. This data is outputted as partner_switching.csv, which can also be downloaded directly.

The roost_switching.csv, cluster_switching.csv, and partner_switching.csv files are required to run the get_switch_prob-03.R file, located in the switching-probabilities folder. This R script takes the datasets generated by the previously mentioned scripts, and creates three datasets that show the probability of switching at a particular scale based on time since last switch at that scale. In these datasets, rows represent different individual vampire bats from empirical data collection, and each column represents a different time since last switch (days for roost switching, hour for cluster switching, minute for partner switching). These files are outputted as roost_switching_probs.csv, cluster_switching_probs.csv, and partner_switching_probs.csv, which can all also be alternatively downloaded directly from the switching-probabilities folder.

The data from roost_switching_probs.csv, cluster_switching_probs.csv, and partner_switching_probs.csv have all been manually inputted into the relevant files that require them as an input. In the NetLogo-models folder, there are two NetLogo files, roost-correlated.nlogo and roost-uncorrelated.nlogo. Both files run an agent-based model where individual vampire bats move at empirically-derived roost switching, cluster switching, and partner switching rates, while the number of switches at each scale and the number of grooming partners is monitored by bat. These files differ only in that switching rates are correlated is roost-correlateed.nlogo, and not correlated in roost-uncorrelated.nlogo (the switching probability matrices in roost-correlated.nlogo are modified so all matrices have the same number of rows, see the supplement of "Hierarchically Embedded Social Dynamics in Vampire Bats" by C. Raven A. Hartman, Imran Razik, Gerald S. Wilkinson, Ian M. Hamilton, Elizabeth A. Hobson, and Gerald G. Carter for details). The number of bats (100 or 200) needs to be manually manipulated by entering the code and changing the value of "Bats." Additionally, whether switching probabilities are variable by bat can be edited in the roost-uncorrelated.R code by commenting out "set roost-switch-vector matrix:get-row  roost-switch-matrix b" and leaving in "set roost-switch-vector matrix:get-row rs-mean-matrix 0" (or cluster, partner) in the setup section to make that switching type non-variable (or vice versa, to make that switcing probability variable). This code generates association data, showing where vampire bats resided each minute, and interaction data, showing a list of all grooming interactions each bat had during the course of the simulation.

The outputs of the NetLogo models are the association and interaction data files, as decribed above, which can be found in the associations folder and interactions folder. These are broken down further into groups of 100. Files 0-99 represent the output of the uncorrelated data file, with all variable movement probabilities, and 200 bats. Files 100-199, uncorrelated, variable roost switching, 200 bats. 200-299, uncorrelated, variable cluster switching, 200 bats. 300-399, uncorrelated, variable partner switching, 200 bats. 400-499, correlated, 200 bats. 500-599, uncorrelated, all variable, 100 bats. Files 600-699, uncorrelated, variable roost switching, 100 bats. 700-799, uncorrelated, variable cluster switching, 100 bats. 800-899, uncorrelated, variable partner switching, 100 bats. 900-999, correlated, 100 bats. These all can be downloaded for direct analysis.

The graphs and analysis folder shows the analysis and plotting code required to make each graph in the paper, "Hierarchically Embedded Social Dynamics in Vampire Bats" by C. Raven A. Hartman, Imran Razik, Gerald S. Wilkinson, Ian M. Hamilton, Elizabeth A. Hobson, and Gerald G. Carter.

The model results are analyzed in via scales_of_movement02.R, found in the Fig4_Fig5_a-e folder in the graphs_and_analysis folder. This code analyzes a subsection of the interaction data files, and outputs the effects of switching rate (standardized coefficients of switching rate) on degree and pagerank. To use this code, the name of the output file and input files must be specified. We used the convention of analyzing by groups of 100. degree_est0.csv was the output of analyzing interactions0.csv through interactions99.csv, and degree_est1.csv was the output of analyzing interaction100.csv through interactions199.csv and so on. degree_est0.csv through degree_est9.csv can be found under the Fig4_Fig5_a-e folder. pagerank_est0.csv through pagerank_est9.csv can likewise be found in the FigS3_FigS4_a-e folder. Fig3_Fig4_a-e.R and FigS4_FigS5_a-e.R create violin-box-and-whisker plots that visualize the effect of movement rates on degree and pagerank, respectively, in 5 different scenarios. We recommend analyzing degree_est0.csv through degree_est4.csv (or the equivalent for pagerank) and degree_est5 though degree_est0.csv separately by replacing XX with the appropriate number (see graph titles).

The other folders contain code relevant for analysis of the empirical data. The FigS2 folder contains social_diff.R, which takes the original data files (wilkinson2.csv, imran.Rdata, events.Rdata) and determines the individual social differentiation, the individual coefficient of variation of edge weight, and outputs a datafile containing these values as roost_soc_diff.csv, cluster_soc_diff.csv, and partner_soc_diff.csv. FigS2.R then takes these files and makes a histogram for roost association, cluster association, and grooming individual social differentiation.

The FigS1 folder contains consecutive.R, which take the original data files (wilkinson2.csv, imran.Rdata, events.Rdata) and find the mean switching rate for every bat in those data files (outputted as roost_sw.csv, cluster_sw.csv, partner_sw.csv, and partners_sw2.csv, which is within-cluster partner switching). FigS1.R plots this data as a histogram.

Then, centrality.R in the Fig2 folder uses the datafiles generated by consecutive.R, as well as partner_switching.csv and transcribe.csv (collected for the studies "Reciprocal Food Sharing in the Vampire Bat" and "The Social Organization of the Common Vampire Bat: I. Pattern and Cause of Association," both by Gerald S. Wilkinson), to output data files (gd.csv for cluster and partner switching, centrality.csv for roost switching) that have the centrality and switching rate for all bats we have data on both. Fig2.R creates three linear model plots showing the relationship between degree centrality and movement rate at each scale.

The Fig3 folder only contains FigS3.R, which requires gd.csv to create a linear model plot showing the relationship between within-cluster partner switching and cluster switching.
